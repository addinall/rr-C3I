// Date         : July  2016
// Author       : Mark Addinall
// Synopsis     : This system is the clone of C3I using newer technology.
//                Although C3I is using VERY up to date tools and design
//                coding concepts, this takes R&D a step further by
//                basing the architecture of this version around
//                React, Redux, immutability and Bootstrap
//                This is the last of my four stack experimental builds
